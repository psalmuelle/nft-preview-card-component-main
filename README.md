## My process

The challenge was quite easy. I learnt a few tricks in CSS though. Like centering a container with flex instead of margin set to 0 and auto. No javascipt was needed! Just plain html and css.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### Continued development

I'm eager to start working on other projects.
Atleast, for now, no further development except improvement from suggestions from my fellow developers
